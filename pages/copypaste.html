						Each year, state lawmakers across the U.S. introduce
						thousands of bills dreamed up and written by
						corporations, industry groups and think tanks.
					</p>

					<p>
						Disguised as the work of lawmakers, these so-called
						“model” bills get copied in one state Capitol after
						another, quietly advancing the agenda of the people who
						write them.
					</p>

					<p>
						A two-year investigation by USA TODAY, The Arizona
						Republic  and the Center for Public Integrity reveals
						for the first time the extent to which special interests
						have infiltrated state legislatures using model
						legislation.
					</p>

					<p>
						USA TODAY and the Republic found at least 10,000 bills
						almost entirely copied from model legislation were
						introduced nationwide in the past eight years, and more
						than 2,100 of those bills were signed into law.
					</p>

					<p>
						The investigation examined nearly 1 million bills in all
						50 states and Congress using a computer algorithm
						developed to detect similarities in language. That
						search – powered by the equivalent of 150 computers that
						ran nonstop for months – compared known model
						legislation with bills introduced by lawmakers.

						The phenomenon of copycat legislation is far larger. In
						a separate analysis, the Center for Public Integrity
						identified tens of thousands of bills with identical
						phrases, then traced the origins of that language in
						dozens of those bills across the country.
					</p>

					<p>
						Model bills passed into law have made it harder for
						injured consumers to sue corporations. They’ve called
						for taxes on sugar-laden drinks. They’ve limited access
						to abortion and restricted the rights of protesters.
					</p>

					<p>
						In all, these copycat bills amount to the nation’s
						largest, unreported special-interest campaign, driving
						agendas in every statehouse and touching nearly every
						area of public policy.

									<div class="statehouse-chatter">
										This story was produced as part of a
										collaboration between USA TODAY, The
										Arizona Republic and the
										<a
											href="https://publicintegrity.org/"
											target="_blank">
											Center for Public Integrity
										</a>
										. More than 30 reporters across the
										country were involved in the two-year
										investigation, which identified copycat
										bills in every state. The team used a
										unique data-analysis engine built on
										hundreds of cloud computers to compare
										millions of words of legislation

					<p>
						The investigation reveals that fill-in-the-blank bills
						have in some states supplanted the traditional approach
						of writing legislation from scratch. They have become so
						intertwined with the lawmaking process that the nation’s
						top sponsor of copycat legislation, a member of the
						Pennsylvania General Assembly, claimed to have signed on
						to 72 such bills without knowing or questioning their
						origin.
					</p>

					<p>
						For lawmakers, copying model legislation is an easy way
						to get fully formed bills to put their names on, while
						building relationships with lobbyists and other
						potential campaign donors.
					</p>

					<p>
						For special interests seeking to stay under the radar,
						model legislation also offers distinct advantages.
						Copycat bills don’t appear on expense reports, or
						campaign finance forms. They don’t require someone to
						register as a lobbyist or sign in at committee hearings.
						But once injected into the lawmaking process, they can
						go viral, spreading state to state, executing an agenda
						to the letter.
					</p>

					<p><strong>USA TODAY’s investigation found:</strong></p>

					<p>
						•Models are drafted with deceptive titles and
						descriptions to disguise their true intent. The Asbestos
						Transparency Act didn’t help people exposed to asbestos.
						It was written by corporations who wanted to make it
						harder for victims to recoup money. The “HOPE Act,”
						introduced in nine states, was written by a conservative
						advocacy group to make it more difficult for people to
						get food stamps.

						•Special interests sometimes work to create the illusion
						of expert endorsements, public consensus or grassroots
						support. One man testified as an expert in 13 states to
						support a bill that makes it more difficult to sue for
						asbestos exposure. In several states, lawmakers weren’t
						told that he was a member of the organization that wrote
						the model legislation on behalf of the asbestos
						industry, the American Legislative Exchange Council.
					</p>

					<p>
						•Bills copied from model legislation have been used to
						override the will of local voters and their elected
						leaders. Cities and counties have raised their minimum
						wage, banned plastic bags and destroyed seized guns,
						only to have industry groups that oppose such measures
						make them illegal with model bills passed in state
						legislatures. Among them: Airbnb has supported the
						conservative Arizona-based Goldwater Institute, which
						pushed model bills to strike down local laws limiting
						short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods in four
						states.
					</p>

					<p>
						•Industry groups have had extraordinary success pushing
						copycat bills that benefit themselves. More than 4,000
						such measures were introduced during the period analyzed
						by USA TODAY/Arizona Republic. One that passed in
						Wisconsin limited pain-and-suffering compensation for
						injured nursing-home residents, restricting payouts to
						lost wages, which the elderly residents don’t have.

						“This work proves what many people have suspected, which
						is just how much of the democratic process has been
						outsourced to special interests,” said Lisa Graves,
						co-director of Documented, which probes corporate
						manipulation of public policy. “It is both astonishing
						and disappointing to see how widespread ... it is. Good
						lord, it’s an amazing thing to see.”
					</p>

					<p>
						The impact of model legislation is undoubtedly larger
						than the 10,000 copied bills identified by USA
						TODAY/Arizona Republic.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because the investigation relied on matching identical
						text, it flagged instances where legislators copied
						model legislation nearly verbatim, but it did not detect
						bills that adapted an idea without using the same
						language.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sherri Greenberg, who spent 10 years in the Texas
						Legislature and is now the Max Sherman Chair in State
						and Local Government at the University of Texas at
						Austin, said bills used to spring from lawmakers’
						experiences, constituents, or lobbyists representing
						long-established industries. Model legislation has
						flourished as gridlock in Congress forced special
						interest groups to look to the states to get things
						done, she said.

						Not all model legislation is driven by special interests
						or designed to make someone money. Some bills were
						written to require sex offenders to register with law
						enforcement, while others have made it easier for
						members of the military to vote or increased penalties
						for human trafficking.
					</p>

					<p>
						Charles Siler, a former external relations manager for
						the Goldwater Institute, which has pushed copycat bills
						nationwide, said it&#39;s a fast way to spread ideas
						because with little modification lawmakers can adapt
						it to their state.
					</p>

					<p>
						“It’s not inherently bad, one way or the other,&#34;
						said Siler, who now works for a political action
						committee. “It depends on the idea and the people
						pushing it. Definitely people use model legislation to
						push bad ideas around.&#34;
					</p>

					<p>
						Allison Anderman, managing attorney at the
						pro-gun-control Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun
						Violence, said model bills are simply how the system
						works now.
					</p>

					<p>
						“This is how all laws are written,” she said. “You’d be
						hard-pressed to find a law where a legislator sits in a
						chamber until a light bulb goes off with a new policy.”

						“Whenever you add transparency to the mix, it helps all
						consumers,” said Sonnenberg, a Republican.
					</p>

					<p>
						But the bill had nothing to do with requiring companies
						to disclose to consumers what products contained
						asbestos or informing those who had been exposed to the
						cancer-causing mineral how to get help.
					</p>

					<p>
						It, in effect, cast corporations as victims of
						litigation filed by people harmed by asbestos. The model
						bill requires people battling the asbestos-triggered
						disease mesothelioma to seek money from an asbestos
						trust, set up to compensate victims, before they can sue
						a company whose product might have caused their cancer.
					</p>

					<p>That process can take months or even a year.</p>

					<p>
						Many mesothelioma victims die within a year of their
						diagnosis. Their families can still
						<strong></strong>
						sue on their behalf, but for far less money.
					</p>

					<p>
						“I can tell you for a fact that families don’t have time
						for all these hoops they want you to jump through,” said
						Chris Winokur, whose husband Bob was diagnosed with
						mesothelioma in 2015 and died nine months
						later. “They’re trying to make it more difficult to
						sue.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Bob Winokur, who worked for the U.S. Forest Service and
						served as mayor of Fort Collins, Colorado, never
						pinpointed where he came in contact with asbestos. And
						he never filed a claim to help pay his medical bills.
						The disease progressed too rapidly to allow it, even
						without the additional requirements proposed by the
						model bill, Chris Winokur said.
					</p>

					<p>
						The model legislation was the work of corporations
						seeking to limit their exposure to billions of dollars
						in litigation associated with asbestos. Insurance
						companies Nationwide, AIG, Travelers, Hartford and CNA
						Financial Corp. together hold more than half the
						nation’s asbestos claim exposure totaling over $870
						million. 
					</p>

					<p>
						USA TODAY/Arizona Republic found the Asbestos
						Transparency Act, a product of the American Legislative
						Exchange Council, an industry-supported model bill
						factory, has been introduced in at least 17 states since
						2012.  It became law in at least 11 states.

						Sonnenberg, the lawmaker who introduced it in Colorado,
						said he didn’t write the bill and relied on “my experts”
						to explain it during a February 2017 hearing. 
					</p>

					<p>
						One of those experts was Mark Behrens, who logs
						thousands of miles a year testifying before lawmakers
						about ALEC&#39;s model asbestos legislation. He has done
						so in at least 13 states, where he was billed as an
						objective authority.
					</p>

					<p>
						Behrens is an attorney with Shook, Hardy and Bacon,
						which represents companies in complex civil litigation.
						 He is a co-chairman of ALEC’s Civil Justice Task Force
						and is a paid consultant for the U.S. Chamber’s

						Sonnenberg told USA TODAY he didn’t know Behrens worked
						for the Chamber of Commerce when he called him to
						testify. “I just knew they were experts and they indeed
						understood the legal issues and process much better than
						I,” he wrote in an email.
					</p>

					<p>
						Behrens said the Asbestos Transparency Act seeks to hold
						wrongdoers accountable, while exonerating innocent
						companies paying for harm they didn’t cause.
					</p>

					<p>
						“These companies don’t get a vote; all we can do is make
						our case,” Behrens told USA TODAY. “I don’t care who I’m
						there for, I still have to be credible and honest.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Graves said special interests have &#34;so-called
						experts who aren&#39;t neutral. They go around the
						country and testify about those bills as if they&#39;re
						good for that state or even as if they&#39;re products
						of that state.&#34;
					</p>

					<p>
						Colorado lawmakers rejected the Asbestos Transparency
						Act in 2017 and 2018, and Sonnenberg said he doesn&#39;t
						plan to introduce it this year.
					</p>

					<p>
						“It would be wise,” he said, “for someone with a better
						understanding of these types of issues to carry the bill
						in the future.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Bill Meierling, chief marketing officer and executive
						vice president of ALEC, said supporters of the asbestos
						model believed it did create more transparency, &#34;but
						it&#39;s up to each individual state to choose how they
						would name&#34; the bill when they copy ALEC&#39;s
						model.
					</p>

					<p>
						USA TODAY found more than 4,000 bills benefiting
						industry were introduced nationwide during the eight
						years it reviewed. More than 80 of those bills limit the
						public&#39;s ability to sue corporations, including
						limiting class-action lawsuits, a plaintiff&#39;s
						ability to offer expert testimony, and cap punitive
						damages for corporate wrongdoing.
					</p>

					<p>
						&#34;No citizens are saying, &#39;Hey, can you make it
						harder to sue if ... low-paid (nursing home) orderlies
						happened to kill or injure my parents,&#39; &#34; Graves
						said. &#34;That&#39;s not a thing citizens are clamoring
						for. But you know who is? The nursing home industry, and
						big business in general.&#34;
					</p>

					<p>
						Many of the bills USA TODAY found were copied from
						models written by special interests were couched in
						unremarkable or technical language that obscured their
						impact. Bans on raising the
						<strong></strong>
						local minimum wage were dubbed &#34;uniform minimum
						wage&#34; laws. Changes to civil court rules to shield
						companies from lawsuits were described
						as &#34;congruity” or reforms to make laws consistent.
						Repealing business regulations was disguised under the
						term &#34;rescission.&#34;

						USA TODAY provided Murt with a list of all 72 bills, 13
						of which became law, and asked questions about his
						support for them. He was the primary sponsor of only
						one: a ban on smoking in workplaces written by the
						liberal State Innovation Exchange.
					</p>

					<p>
						Murt said he would reconsider his support for two of the
						bills that were copied from ALEC, after learning more
						about their impact. One was a call for a constitutional
						convention to curb federal spending, backed by the
						controversial Koch brothers conservative political
						network. The other was a bill protecting Crown Cork
						&amp; Seal from asbestos liability.
					</p>

						&#34;I would be suspect of such a
						proposal,&#34; Murt said of the constitutional
						convention model. &#34;But bear in mind that when that
						co-sponsor memo was circulated, I&#39;m sure it never
						mentioned the Koch brothers, because for some people
						that would have been a show-stopper.&#34;
					</p>

					<p>
						Murt also said he would never support limiting asbestos
						victims&#39; ability to sue.

						USA TODAY interviewed more than 50 sponsors of model
						legislation nationwide. Half said they knew they had
						sponsored model legislation. But 20 legislators said
						they didn’t know the source of their bill or claimed
						they wrote at least part of the bill.
					</p>

					<p>
						Five insisted the bill was their own work, even though
						the wording of each included multiple passages that
						matched model legislation nearly verbatim. Almost all of
						the sponsors defended the practice of copying model
						legislation or had no opinion of it.
					</p>

					<p>
						In Michigan, Republican state Sen. Joe Haveman said he
						worked with a lobbyist from a Lansing law firm to draft
						his state’s version of the law aimed at shielding Crown
						Cork &amp; Seal from asbestos liability stemming from a
						corporate merger in the 1960s. The law firm, Clark Hill,
						has donated $1,800 to his campaigns since 2012,
						according to state records.

						“It really had nothing to do with my passion for
						anything. They had to do this in all 50 states,” Haveman
						said. &#34;Somebody targeted me, and I had to do it.”
					</p>

					<p>
						It’s not just legislators circulating copycat bills. In
						Pennsylvania, the nonpartisan service that drafts all
						bills for the state Assembly – the Legislative Reference
						Bureau – frequently copies directly from model
						legislation, said director Vincent DeLiberato. But the
						legislator ultimately decides whether to use
						it, he said.
					</p>

					<p>
						In Wisconsin, the Legislature’s nonpartisan legal staff
						is similarly tasked with converting lawmakers’ ideas
						into bills. A March 1, 2017, email to that staff from
						the office of Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos
						requested that an attached document be “drafted as
						stated.”

						The document contained the Campus Free Speech Act, which
						prevents universities from blocking controversial
						speakers and imposes penalties on students, including
						expulsion, for disrupting such events. The measure,
						written by the Goldwater Institute, is a reaction to
						liberal protesters at Middlebury College, UC-Berkeley,
						University of Florida and other campuses who have
						disrupted speeches by conservative commentator Ben
						Shapiro and white supremacist Richard Spencer, among
						others. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Vos did not respond to questions about the origin of his
						bill, which was copied nearly verbatim from
						Goldwater&#39;s model. It didn’t pass, but the ideas
						were incorporated in new university rules adopted by
						Wisconsin.
					</p>

					<p>
						USA TODAY’s algorithm found the same model was
						introduced in 13 states, becoming law in Arizona and
						North Carolina. A similar version passed in Colorado.
					</p>

					<p>
						The relationship between groups writing model
						legislation and the lawmakers introducing them is a
						marriage of convenience, experts said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Special interests give lawmakers fully conceived bills
						they can put their names on and take credit for. And
						those special interests can become dependable donors to
						their campaigns.
					</p>

					<p>
						Conservative groups like ALEC nurture those
						relationships at annual conferences where lawmakers and
						corporate lobbyists discuss policy and mingle over meals
						and drinks paid for by corporate sponsors.
					</p>

					<p>
						This arrangement is particularly appealing to new
						lawmakers, said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, an assistant
						professor at Columbia University who has studied the
						influence of ALEC and other conservative groups.

						His research showed less-experienced lawmakers are more
						likely to use copycat legislation.
					</p>

					<p>
						They “know they are conservative, they know they are
						pro-business, but ... they don’t really know what it
						means to translate that into different bills,” he said.
						“These networks are able to fill in what it means to be
						a conservative Republican who wants to support
						business.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Meierling, ALEC&#39;s chief marketing officer, said
						there are checks and balances on corporate influence
						within the organization &#34;just like our government
						structure.&#34;
					</p>

					<p>
						Companies join ALEC because they want feedback and
						insight from a variety of legislators, he said.
					</p>

					<p>
						&#34;Sure they (companies) are going to share their
						perspective, but a legislator is there to represent
						their constituents and if they don&#39;t they&#39;ll be
						held accountable at the ballot box,&#34; Meierling said.
						&#34;ALEC ... has proven it’s an asset to society.&#34;
					</p>

					<p>
						Progressive groups, meanwhile, have failed to replicate
						conservatives’ success because they’ve not invested in
						facilitating the relationships between lawmakers and
						special interests, Hertel-Fernandez said.
					</p>

					<p>
						“What ALEC does is more than provide the model
						bills: They provide relationships. They approach you
						when you are first elected and build these enduring
						social connections with you at recurring events that
						happen every year,” he said. “You really need that
						social connection in addition to the model-bill
						resources that you’re getting, the research help.”

						“Countless American lives will be saved. ... I don’t
						want to say thousands because I think it’s going to be
						much more – hundreds of thousands,” President Donald
						Trump said at a signing ceremony for the national “Right
						to Try” bill in May 2018.  “It is such a great name.
						From the first day I loved it. It’s so perfect: Right.
						To. Try.” 
					</p>

					<p>
						With the stroke of a pen, Trump made a bill that
						had circulated in statehouses for four years the most
						successful copycat bill in history. Not only did it pass
						in 41 states, it also had conquered Congress. 
					</p>

					<p>
						The version passed by Congress allows terminally ill
						individuals a right to try experimental medications that
						have not been fully approved by the Food and Drug
						Administration.  
					</p>

					<p>
						The bill’s title left the public with the impression it
						was spurred by a groundswell of patients
						demanding lifesaving treatment.
					</p>

					<p>
						Instead, it was a focus group-tested name, coined by a
						consultant to a for-profit corporation.
					</p>

						Former Goldwater President Darcy Olsen parlayed this

						Cancer Treatment Centers of
						America approached Goldwater for help addressing a
						“national medical emergency”: the government
						blocking terminally ill patients from
						receiving potential lifesaving treatments. 
					</p>

					<p>
						When asked, Goldwater could not produce any of those
						patients.  
					</p>

					<p>
						Chuck Warren, corporate consultant to Cancer Treatment
						Centers of America, said he came up with the bill’s
						name. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Goldwater and CTCA paid for focus groups to make sure
						the name struck the right chord. “It was always our
						favorite name and it was the name that resonated the
						most with focus groups,” Warren said.

						While the marketing was cutting edge, its policy largely
						had been implemented decades earlier.
					</p>

					<p>
						Alison Bateman-House, an assistant professor of medical
						ethics at New York University’s Langone Health, said
						Right to Try is “an effort to address a problem that did
						not actually exist.” Patients have been able to access
						experimental drugs since the 1970s, she said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Through the FDA’s
						<strong></strong>
						compassionate-use program, about 1,000 patients a year
						have gained access to non-approved drugs in recent
						years. The FDA approves more than 90 percent of those
						requests, often within days and, in emergencies,
						sometimes more quickly. 
					</p>

					<p>
						“The Goldwater Institute was taking advantage of a very
						heart-rending and sympathetic issue to push for their
						pet policy, which is basically to roll back
						regulations,” Bateman-House said. “They did pick a
						winner of a name. ... Unfortunately, it’s a lie.”
					</p>

					<p>
						It’s unclear how many people have received experimental
						drugs through Right to Try. Bateman-House said she’s
						heard of two. Goldwater points to those same two
						patients, and a Texas doctor who ran a trial involving
						200 patients. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Goldwater CEO Victor Riches said those were only the
						individuals who informed his organization about their
						success using the law. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Riches said Goldwater crafts legislation it sees a need
						for in Arizona, where it&#39;s based. It then considers
						the “exportability” of its model legislation to other
						states, he said.
					</p>

					<p>
						Goldwater’s strategy for Right to Try was to get it
						passed in as many states as possible to pressure
						Congress to enact a version, Riches said. 
					</p>

					<p>
						“When you are in 41 states and you&#39;ve had literally
						thousands of legislators, Democrats and Republicans
						alike, it is hard for the federal government not to take
						notice,” he said. 
					</p>

					<p>
						It’s even harder to pin down what problem the American
						Laws for American Courts bill is solving.
					</p>

					<p>
						The model bill, which was introduced in legislatures 53
						times during the past eight years, mandates judges&#39;
						rulings be void if based on a foreign law or doctrine
						that violates the rights granted to U.S. citizens under
						the Constitution or state law. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Even backers struggle to identify situations where this
						has occurred.

						“This is a solution looking for a problem,” said
						Ahmed Abdelnaby, an engineer who testified against the

					</p>

					<p>
						While proponents are unable to cite court cases where
						U.S. law has been supplanted by Sharia or some other
						doctrine, those lobbying for it collected about $206
						million in donations between 2008 and 2013, according to
						a study released by the Council on American-Islamic

						Minnesota state Rep. Steve Drazkowski, who co-sponsored
						similar legislation in 2016, said some people fear
						Sharia law will be applied in the U.S., but he does not.
					</p>

					<p>
						Drazkowski also pushed a bill in 2011 to declare English
						as the official language of Minnesota and prohibit
						conducting routine business in foreign languages,
						including driver’s license exams. The bill was
						strikingly similar to model legislation by a group
						called ProEnglish, which calls itself the “nation&#39;s
						leading advocate for official English.”
					</p>

					<p>
						The Saint Paul Pioneer Press editorialized that
						Drazkowski was using it to ensure his reelection by
						“pandering to the mostly conservative and card-carrying
						residents of … the paranoid states of America.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Drazkowski said he is aware of ProEnglish but couldn’t
						remember where he got the language for his English-only
						bill.
					</p>

					<p>
						“The use of these model bills is not the end of the
						world,” he said, noting that immigrants are more
						successful when they learn English. “The idea that one
						organization or group is somehow controlling legislation
						or legislators or states, that’s a fallacy.”

					<p>
						For Susan Edwards, it seemed like a godsend when Arizona
						lawmakers introduced a bill to create a new kind of
						school voucher for students with disabilities.
					</p>

					<p>
						With the money – funded by dollars taken from a
						recipient’s local district school – the mother of two
						children on the autism spectrum could send her kids to a
						private school where they would receive specialized
						attention they wouldn’t get elsewhere.
					</p>

					<p>
						With a sympathetic group of students as the face of the
						legislation, Democrats and Republicans rallied behind
						the 2011 bill which borrowed language from the Goldwater
						Institute, ALEC, and American Federation for Children,
						the pro-school choice group founded by U.S. Secretary of
						Education Betsy DeVos.
					</p>

					<p>
						Edwards’ opinion of the program, however, changed
						drastically as legislators later introduced bill after
						bill to give vouchers to more students, culminating in
						lawmakers approving them for all students.
					</p>

					<p>
						None of those bills, however, guaranteed Edwards’ sons
						and others with disabilities
						<strong></strong>
						could keep their vouchers as more students were added.
						She didn’t know it at the time, but lawmakers were
						drawing their ideas from model legislation.
					</p>

						Edwards said she realized in retrospect that students
						with disabilities were used as a Trojan horse to put on
						the legislative agenda a fringe idea that was part of a
						much bigger campaign. In the years that followed, 19
						other states debated 93 nearly identical proposals based
						on model legislation. They became law in Florida,
						Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina and Tennessee.
					</p>

					<p>
						&#34;Every single, little expansion, if you look at
						who&#39;s behind it, it is the people that want to get
						that door kicked open for private religious
						education,&#34; Edwards said. &#34;All we (families with
						disabled students) are was the way for them to crack
						open the door.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Riches, Goldwater&#39;s CEO, said starting the
						Empowerment Scholarship Account voucher program with a
						small group of students and expanding it was the best
						approach.
					</p>

					<p>
						&#34;When you are talking about a big idea, a new idea,
						usually the best way of approaching it is to wade into
						it and demonstrate it can work on a smaller level and
						then grow it from there,” Riches said.
					</p>

					<p>
						The groups behind Arizona’s move toward universal
						vouchers, however, were shown in indisputable terms that
						the public opposed their ideas.
					</p>

					<p>
						On Election Day 2018, Arizona voters rejected universal
						vouchers by a 65-35 margin.
					</p>

					<p>
						It was only the most recent example of model legislation
						that didn’t reflect the will of voters, USA
						TODAY/Arizona Republic found.
					</p>

					<p>
						Model-legislation factories have increasingly proposed
						what are known as &#34;preemption&#34; bills. These
						laws, in effect, allow state legislators to dictate to
						city councils and county governing boards what they can
						and cannot do within their jurisdiction—including
						preventing them from raising the minimum wage, banning
						plastic grocery bags, and destroying guns.
						<strong></strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						USA TODAY’s algorithm found more than 100 such bills had
						been introduced on an expanding array of topics.
					</p>

					<p>
						Kansas stopped local efforts to require restaurants to
						list calories on their menus.
					</p>

					<p>
						Arizona and New Hampshire prevented local regulations on
						home rentals. Airbnb has lobbied against home-sharing
						restrictions, often with the Goldwater Institute&#39;s
						assistance.
					</p>

					<p>
						One model pushed by ALEC and the Goldwater Institute
						prohibits local jurisdictions from creating occupational
						licensing requirements. It reflects conservatives’ and
						libertarians’ belief that job licensing stifles
						competition and hurts the economy, and should only be
						required when it involves health and safety.
					</p>

					<p>
						Drazkowski, the Minnesota representative, said he
						introduced such a bill “so you don’t have a patchwork
						kind of discombobulated mess of different ordinances
						from one community to the next.”
					</p>

					<p>
						But Riches said his group stopped promoting similar
						model legislation because of the public outcry.
					</p>

					<p>
						“We found very quickly that you bring people out of the
						woodwork when you try to get rid of occupational
						licenses,” he said. “What I would refer to as the
						status-quo crowd.”

						Goldwater returned with another that allows anyone
						who&#39;s been harmed by occupational regulation to sue
						for damages, including harm that occurred before the law
						was enacted.
					</p>

					<p>
						It was introduced in at least five states and passed in
						Arizona. But Riches acknowledged no one has used it to
						file suit, and the only beneficiary he can point to is a
						person with ties to the administration of Arizona Gov.
						Doug Ducey, a vocal supporter of occupational licensing
						restrictions.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because preemption bills have almost exclusively been
						advanced by Republicans, many of whom rail against the
						excessive mandates of Washington, D.C., critics see such
						legislation as the height of hypocrisy.
					</p>

					<p>
						&#34;There&#39;s real ... hypocrisy in many of these
						so-called conservative legislators trying to rip away
						local control when they preached for years that a
						government that&#39;s closest to you ... is most
						responsive to you,&#34; said Dawn Penich-Thacker, who
						campaigned to overturn Arizona&#39;s school-voucher
						expansion with a public vote.
					</p>

					<p>
						Penich-Thacker saw a similar disregard for the will of
						voters when within hours of Arizonans’ vote to overturn
						universal school vouchers, the Goldwater Institute and
						American Federation Children declared they would
						continue to feed their model proposals to state
						lawmakers.

						Bills to modify Arizona&#39;s voucher program were soon
						introduced. One bore a striking resemblance to model
						legislation from the Heartland Institute, granting
						vouchers to any parent who feels their child is unsafe
						or being bullied at school.
					</p>

					<p>
						The sponsor, Shawnna Bolick, denied any knowledge of the
						Heartland model. Her bill, she said, was based
						on the experience of her daughter.
					</p>

					<p>
						Edwards, the voucher supporter-turned opponent, noted
						that just like the first Arizona bill granting vouchers
						to children with disabilities, Bolick had sympathetic
						victims—kids who&#39;d been bullied—to help sell her
						bill.
					</p>

					<p>
						“It really does seem like you are fighting against the
						tide,” Edwards said
						<strong></strong>
						of the influence of model legislation and the groups
						behind it. “They are ignoring the vote of the people.”
					</p>

					<p>
						A letter to the editor appeared in The Arizona Republic
						defending renewed efforts to expand the voucher
						program despite defeat at the ballot box.
					</p>

					<p>
						The letter’s author, Scott Kaufman, wasn’t a concerned
						parent, or even an Arizona resident.
					</p>

					<p>
						He had sent his letter from the Washington, D.C.,
						suburbs, from a model-bill factory: the American
						Legislative Exchange Council.
					</p>
